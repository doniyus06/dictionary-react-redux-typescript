# dictionary-react-redux-typescript

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goblindegook/dictionary-react-redux-typescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goblindegook/dictionary-react-redux-typescript)

A simple React + Redux application written in TypeScript.

## Installation

1. I recommend that you install package dependencies using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): `yarn install`. Vanilla NPM could work, but you're on your own if it installs the wrong package versions.
2. Build the project's static assets by running `npm run build`.
3. Start the project with `npm start` and open your browser of choice at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
